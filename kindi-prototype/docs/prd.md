# Kindi Intelligence Analysis Platform
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Create an intuitive interface for intelligence analysts to visualize and interact with complex data
- Enable analysts to uncover connections across relationships, time, and geography simultaneously
- Reduce the time required to identify patterns and generate insights from complex datasets
- Eliminate the need for manual cross-referencing between different visualization tools
- Provide a unified analysis environment that works with static datasets initially
- Support future integration with backend data services

#### Background Context
Intelligence analysts currently struggle with fragmented tools that force them to manually cross-reference information across different visualization paradigms. This creates cognitive overload, slows down analysis, and increases the risk of missed connections. Kindi addresses this challenge by providing a unified interface where relationship graphs, chronological timelines, and geographic maps are synchronized, allowing analysts to see the same data from multiple perspectives simultaneously. The initial version will work with static datasets, with architecture designed to support future backend integration.

### User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision
The Kindi platform provides a seamless, unified analysis experience where multiple visualization paradigms work in harmony. The interface emphasizes clarity, minimizes cognitive load, and puts the focus on the data and connections. The design should feel intuitive to intelligence professionals, with familiar visualization conventions enhanced by synchronized interaction patterns that make complex analysis feel natural and efficient.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Synchronized Selection**: Selecting an element in any visualization highlights related elements in all views
- **Contextual Detail**: Right sidebar Inspector panel shows details only when elements are selected
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex filtering options appear only when needed
- **Consistent Navigation**: Similar interaction patterns across all visualization types
- **Spatial Memory**: Persistent layout helps analysts build mental maps of the data
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag, zoom, and click directly on visualizations rather than through controls

#### Core Screens and Views
- Main Dashboard (Three-Panel Visualization)
- Control Panel (Left Sidebar)
- Inspector Panel (Right Sidebar)
- Data Loading/Selection Screen
- Saved Views Manager
- Export/Share Interface

#### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system will follow WCAG AA guidelines to ensure accessibility, including:
- Sufficient color contrast for all interface elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all functions
- Screen reader compatibility for critical information
- Text alternatives for non-text content
- Resizable text without loss of functionality

#### Branding
The Kindi platform should have a professional, clean aesthetic appropriate for intelligence analysis work. The interface should use a neutral color palette with accent colors reserved for highlighting important information and connections. The visual design should prioritize clarity and readability over decorative elements.

#### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The primary platform is desktop web browsers, with responsive design to support various screen sizes. Mobile support is a secondary consideration, with the understanding that complex analysis is primarily performed on larger screens.

### Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project will use a monorepo structure to maintain all components in a single repository, facilitating easier coordination between the visualization components and shared utilities.

#### Service Architecture
The initial implementation will be a client-side application with no backend dependencies, using static JSON data files. The architecture will be designed to support future backend integration through well-defined data interfaces. State management will use Context API for simplicity in the initial version, with consideration for Redux if complexity increases.

#### Testing Requirements
The system requires comprehensive testing across all visualization components:
- Unit tests for core utilities and data transformations
- Component tests for individual visualization elements
- Integration tests for synchronized interactions between visualizations
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Browser compatibility testing across major platforms

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Next.js will be used as the React framework for the application
- Tailwind CSS will be used for styling and responsive design
- Visualization libraries: react-force-graph, vis-timeline, and react-leaflet
- Initial development will use static JSON data files
- TypeScript will be used for type safety and better developer experience
- The application will be designed for offline functionality after initial load
- The architecture should support future backend integration without major refactoring
