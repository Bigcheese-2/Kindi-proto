# Story 1.2: Basic Layout Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure
Based on the architecture document, the layout components should be organized as follows:
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#directory-structure]

```
app/
├── components/
│   ├── core/            # Basic UI components
│   ├── layout/          # Layout components including the panels
│   └── visualizations/  # Placeholder visualization components
├── page.tsx             # Main application page
└── layout.tsx           # Root layout
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#component-architecture]

The layout should follow the component architecture defined in the architecture document, with the following structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Pages] --> B[Layouts]
    B --> C[Main Dashboard Layout]
    C --> D[Graph Panel<br>Top Left]
    C --> E[Timeline Panel<br>Bottom]
    C --> F[Map Panel<br>Top Right]
    C --> G[Control Panel<br>Left Sidebar]
    C --> H[Inspector Panel<br>Right Sidebar]
```

### User Flow
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#user-flow]

The layout should support the following user flow:

1. User opens the application and sees the main dashboard with three panels
2. The panels should be positioned with Graph (top left), Timeline (bottom), and Map (top right)
3. The Control Panel should be on the left sidebar
4. The Inspector Panel should be on the right sidebar, initially collapsed
5. The layout should allow for panel resizing and sidebar toggling

### UI Context
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#core-state-contexts]

The UI state should be managed using the UIContext with the following structure:

```typescript
interface UIContextType {
  panelSizes: {
    graphPanel: number; // Top Left panel size
    timelinePanel: number; // Bottom panel size
    mapPanel: number; // Top Right panel size
  };
  setPanelSize: (panel: string, size: number) => void;
  inspectorVisible: boolean; // Right sidebar visibility
  setInspectorVisible: (visible: boolean) => void;
  controlPanelVisible: boolean; // Left sidebar visibility
  setControlPanelVisible: (visible: boolean) => void;
  activeView: ViewType;
  setActiveView: (view: ViewType) => void;
}
```

### Testing

#### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#testing-strategy]

For this story, focus on:

1. **Component Testing**: Test the rendering and basic functionality of layout components
2. **Responsive Testing**: Test the layout at different screen sizes
3. **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different layout components

Test files should be organized in the `tests` directory with appropriate subdirectories for unit and integration tests.
