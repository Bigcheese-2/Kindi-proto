```

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#technology-stack]

The project requires the following technologies:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.0 with React 19.1.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **Build Tools**: Turbopack (via Next.js)
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Visualization Libraries
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#visualization-libraries]

The following visualization libraries will be used in the project:

- **Network Graph**: react-force-graph (3D force-directed graph)
- **Timeline**: vis-timeline (interactive timeline visualization)
- **Map**: react-leaflet (interactive maps with Leaflet)

### Development Tools
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#development-tools]

The project should be configured with:

- **Linting**: ESLint 9.x
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks

### Testing

#### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/technical-architecture-document.md#testing-strategy]

The testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions, hooks, and components in isolation
2. **Component Testing**: Test component rendering and interactions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between related components
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete user flows in a browser environment
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets to ensure performance requirements are met

For this initial story, focus on setting up the testing infrastructure with Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component tests. Configure the test environment to support the project's needs.
