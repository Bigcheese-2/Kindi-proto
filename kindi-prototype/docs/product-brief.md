# Kindi Intelligence Analysis Platform
## Product Brief

### Executive Summary
Kindi is an advanced intelligence analysis platform designed to empower analysts with powerful visualization and data interaction capabilities. The platform integrates multiple visualization techniques (graph networks, timelines, and geospatial mapping) into a cohesive interface, enabling analysts to rapidly identify patterns, connections, and insights from complex datasets.

### Problem Statement
Intelligence analysts face significant challenges when working with large, complex datasets:
- Difficulty visualizing connections between entities across different dimensions (relationships, time, location)
- Time-consuming manual cross-referencing between different data views
- Cognitive overload from switching between multiple tools and interfaces
- Limited ability to quickly filter and focus on relevant data subsets
- Inefficient workflows that slow down the analysis process

### Solution Overview
Kindi provides a unified intelligence analysis environment with synchronized, interactive visualizations that enable analysts to:
- View entity relationships, chronological events, and geographic data simultaneously
- Seamlessly transition between different perspectives of the same data
- Apply filters and selections that propagate across all visualization components
- Access detailed information about entities and events without losing context
- Generate insights faster through intuitive interaction patterns

### Core Features

#### 1. Multi-Modal Visualization Dashboard
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Simultaneous display of Graph, Timeline, and Map visualizations
- **Synchronized Selection**: Selecting an element in one view highlights related elements in all views
- **Coordinated Filtering**: Filters applied in one visualization propagate to others
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes with adjustable panel proportions

#### 2. Interactive Network Graph (using react-force-graph)
- Entity relationship visualization with customizable node and edge styling
- Force-directed layout with physics controls for optimal spacing
- Zoom, pan, and focus capabilities
- Node clustering and filtering by entity type
- Search and highlight functionality

#### 3. Chronological Timeline (using vis-timeline)
- Event sequencing with customizable event types and categories
- Time range selection and zooming capabilities
- Vertical stacking of concurrent events
- Timeline filtering by entity, event type, or custom parameters
- Highlighting of critical events and time periods

#### 4. Geospatial Mapping (using react-leaflet)
- Entity and event positioning on interactive maps
- Multiple base map options (satellite, terrain, street)
- Heat maps showing activity concentration
- Path visualization for movement tracking
- Location clustering for dense data areas

#### 5. Contextual Inspector Panel
- Detailed entity/event information display
- Associated metadata and attributes
- Related entities and connections
- Historical context and source information
- Quick actions for further analysis

#### 6. Advanced Filtering and Search
- Global search across all data dimensions
- Multi-parameter filtering with saved filter sets
- Dynamic query building interface
- Results highlighting across all visualizations
- Filter history and comparison

### User Experience

#### User Personas
1. **Intelligence Analyst**: Professional analyst working with complex datasets to identify patterns and generate insights
2. **Investigation Lead**: Subject matter expert coordinating team efforts and setting analysis priorities
3. **Field Operator**: User needing quick access to specific intelligence in operational contexts

#### Key User Flows

**1. Initial Data Exploration**
- User loads a dataset into the platform
- The three visualization panels populate with the data
- User gets immediate overview of entities (graph), events (timeline), and locations (map)
- User can quickly identify areas of interest for deeper analysis

**2. Entity-Focused Analysis**
- User identifies an entity of interest in the graph panel
- User selects the entity, triggering:
  - Inspector panel slides out with detailed entity information
  - Timeline filters to show only events involving the entity
  - Map highlights locations associated with the entity
- User can explore the entity's connections, activities, and movements comprehensively

**3. Event Investigation**
- User notices a significant event on the timeline
- User selects the event, causing:
  - Inspector panel updates with event details
  - Graph highlights entities involved in the event
  - Map centers on the event location
- User can understand the context, participants, and spatial aspects of the event

**4. Pattern Recognition**
- User applies filters to focus on specific time periods, entity types, or geographic regions
- All visualizations update to reflect the filtered dataset
- User can identify patterns that would be difficult to detect in isolated views
- User can save and share insights with annotations

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - react-force-graph for network visualization
  - vis-timeline for chronological data
  - react-leaflet for geospatial mapping
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for application state

#### Data Management
- **Mock Data**: Initial development using static JSON dummy data
- **Local Storage**: Client-side data persistence for settings and user preferences
- **Future API Integration**: Architecture designed to easily connect to backend services when available
- **Offline Functionality**: Core features available without network connectivity

#### Data Requirements
- **Data Format**: Standardized JSON structure for entities, relationships, events, and locations
- **Data Volume**: Support for datasets with thousands of entities and relationships
- **Sample Datasets**: Multiple dummy datasets for different analysis scenarios
- **Export Capabilities**: Data and visualization export in standard formats

### Implementation Roadmap
